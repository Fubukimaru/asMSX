# asMSX testing guide

We use [Google Test](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/master/googletest/docs/primer.md) framework for our test coverage.

Currently only one basic test for build_tape_file_name() function is implemented.
Test unit works fine in Windows with Visual Studio 2019 Community.
Linux and macOS support is coming shortly.
